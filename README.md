Cuisine Combinations: Some combinations (e.g., Italian with Bakery, American with Coffee/BBQ) consistently achieve high ratings. Simple single cuisines like North Indian are frequent but show average scores.

Geographic Insights: Mapping longitude and latitude shows clusters of restaurants in metro regions. This highlights competitive zones with heavy customer concentration.
